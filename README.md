Nemoa
========

*Nemoa* is a python package for designing and building complex systems of
stacked artificial neural networks. The key goal of this project is to provide
an intuitive framework for designing data transformations which implement given
requirements and also respect local and global restrictions of the underlying
data structure. Common requirements for example are reconstruction of missing
information, data classification, structural data analysis or data
dimensionality reduction.

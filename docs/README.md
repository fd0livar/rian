Nemoa
========

*Nemoa* is a python package for designing and building complex systems of stacked artificial neural networks. The key goal of this project is to provide an intuitive framework for designing data transformations which implement given requirements and also respect local and global restrictions of the underlying data structure. Common requirements for example are reconstruction of missing information, data classification, structural data analysis or data dimensionality reduction.

##### Contributing #####
If you are new to the field of [artificial neural networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) than let me give you a motivational example: Assume an *automatic intelligent system for human disease detection* which uses complex information like [gene expression data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression) and a central storage and analysing system like nemoa, which continously optimizes and analyses large instances of artificial neural networks to detect and forecast human diseases from measurement of single patients or even whole communities. This is technically possible and not even very complicated! Of course the main tasks in this example are proper data anonymization to respect data privacy and centralization to handle data federalism, but if those tasks could be solved this could vastly improve and speed up medical diagnostics.

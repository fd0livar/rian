Nemoa
=====

*Nemoa* is a python package for deep data analysis and visualization by
including structural assumptions within probabilistic graphical models. The key
goal of this project is to provide an intuitive framework for building and
analysing complex systems of stacked graphical models. Common requirements are
pattern recognition, reconstruction of missing information, data classification,
structural data analysis or data dimensionality reduction.

Nemoa
=====

*Nemoa* is a python framework for *deep data analysis*. In many domains of
statistical data analysis the lack of strong structural beliefs encourages the
use of deep structured models to provide a sufficient structural flexibility.
This high degree of freedom, however, is usually paid for by complicated model
spaces, that are barely accessible by classical statistical approaches.

The key goal of nemoa is to provide an intuitive framework for deep data
analysis, that extends classical statistical approaches by methods from
differential geometry and differential topology. The fields of applications
comprise nonlinear association analysis, reconstruction of missing data,
classification tasks and data dimensionality reduction.
